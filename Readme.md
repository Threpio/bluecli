# BlueCLI

Heavily opinionated Azure CLI written in Rust.

I couldn't think of a name that combines 'Azure' and 'Rust'.

### Wishlist
- [ ] Self defined (not reliant on az cli) azure authentication flow.
- [ ] Ability to create, manage and understand resource groups.
- [ ] Ability to create, manage and understand storage accounts, containers & blob storage.
- [ ] Ability to blanket text search the url for any resource with no management capability


### Stretch Goals
- [ ] Ability to create, manage and deploy azure function apps
- [ ] Ability to create, manage and deploy AKS resources and clusters
- [ ] Other authentication methods (service principle)
