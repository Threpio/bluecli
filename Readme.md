# BlueCLI

Heavily opinionated Azure CLI written in Rust.

I couldn't think of a name that combines 'Azure' and 'Rust'.

### Wishlist
- [x] Self defined (not reliant on az cli) azure device-code authentication flow.
- [ ] Authentication permanence/refresh token handling. 
- [ ] Ability to create, manage and understand resource groups.
- [ ] Ability to create, manage and understand storage accounts, containers & blob storage.
- [ ] Ability to blanket text search the url for any resource with no management capability.


### Stretch Goals
- [ ] Ability to create, manage and deploy azure function apps.
- [ ] Ability to create, manage and deploy AKS resources and clusters.
- [ ] Other authentication methods (service principle).
